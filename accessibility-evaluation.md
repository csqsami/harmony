## What is web accessibility?
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are an internationally recognised set of recommendations for improving web accessibility, to ensure websites and apps are made accessible for everyone.

There are four design principles:
1. Perceivable
2. Operable
3. Understandable
4. Robust
