## What is web accessibility?
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are an internationally recognised set of recommendations for improving web accessibility, to ensure websites and apps are made accessible for everyone.

There are four design principles:
1. Perceivable
2. Operable
3. Understandable
4. Robust

There are 13 guidelines in WCAG 2.2. Each of these is broken down into specific requirements (or ‘success criteria’) that your service needs to meet. To ensure your design, code and content comply with WCAG, you should conduct regular accessibility testing with assitive technologies and meet a standard of Level AA (passing Level A too).

## Accessibility audit
3. Perceivable
2.1 Text Alternatives
Images:
Verify that all images have appropriate alt text.
Check for decorative images using empty alt attributes.
2.2 Time-based Media
Audio/Video:
Ensure captions are provided for all audio content.
Check for transcripts for audio and video.
Ensure video content has audio descriptions.
2.3 Adaptable
Content Structure:
Ensure content is structured using proper headings (<h1> to <h6>).
Check for the correct use of landmarks (e.g., header, nav, main, footer).
2.4 Distinguishable
Color Contrast:
Verify color contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 guidelines (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
Text Resizing:
Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
4. Operable
3.1 Keyboard Accessible
Navigation:
Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons, form controls) are keyboard accessible.
Verify focus indicators are visible.
3.2 Enough Time
Time Limits:
Check for adjustable or extendable time limits.
3.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions
Content Safety:
Ensure content does not contain flashes that could cause seizures (no more than three flashes per second).
3.4 Navigable
Navigation Aids:
Ensure a logical and consistent navigation order.
Verify presence of skip links.
Ensure all pages have descriptive titles.
Link Purpose:
Check that link text is descriptive and meaningful.
5. Understandable
4.1 Readable
Language:
Ensure the language of the page is declared in the HTML.
Reading Level:
Check for content that is readable and understandable for the intended audience.
4.2 Predictable
Consistency:
Ensure navigation and interactive elements are consistent throughout the site.
Unexpected Changes:
Verify that changes in context (e.g., new pages opening) are predictable and notified.
4.3 Input Assistance
Forms:
Ensure form elements have associated labels.
Check for clear instructions and error messages.
Verify that input errors are identified and suggestions for correction are provided.
6. Robust
5.1 Compatible
Assistive Technologies:
Verify that the website is compatible with various assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers, speech recognition software).
HTML Validation:
Ensure HTML/CSS is valid and follows best practices.
