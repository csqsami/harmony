## What is web accessibility?
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are an internationally recognised set of recommendations for improving web accessibility, to ensure websites and apps are made accessible for everyone.

There are four design principles:
1. Perceivable
2. Operable
3. Understandable
4. Robust

There are 13 guidelines in WCAG 2.2. Each of these is broken down into specific requirements (or ‘success criteria’) that your service needs to meet. To ensure your design, code and content comply with WCAG, you should conduct regular accessibility testing with assitive technologies and meet a standard of Level AA (passing Level A too).
