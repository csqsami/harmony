# Task 7. Give a similarity function between questionnaires (the H-score!)

Eve Cheng has done some experiments with the Word Movers Distance algorithm which gives the distance between two sequences of sentence embeddings.

Can Harmony use this to say that the GAD-7 is e.g. 60% similar to the PHQ-9?

We also have a demo of Harmony integrated with external data sources: https://harmonyclosermockup2.azurewebsites.net/
