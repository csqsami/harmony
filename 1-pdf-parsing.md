# Task 1. PDF parsing

Address and fix issues related to processing PDFs within Harmony, as identified in the Kaggle competition. Improve PDF handling for more seamless integration. Handle Excels and Word docs.

## About Harmony's Functionality

Harmony has developed a cutting-edge functionality that allows users to upload a PDF document, which the system then processes to identify and extract the text of questionnaire questions. This technology represents a significant advancement in the field of document processing and data extraction. You can try Harmony at harmonydata.ac.uk.

Demo of Harmony's Functionality: For a better understanding of what we aim to achieve, participants can view a demo of Harmony's current PDF processing functionality on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEZppTBj1NI&t=1s).

## Objective

The objective is to build upon Harmony's existing technology to create a more efficient, accurate, and robust tool for extracting questionnaire questions from a variety of documents. Participants are encouraged to innovate and develop solutions that can handle a wide range of document formats and structures.

## Data

We have lots of example PDFs, together with the ground truths (what questions should be extracted), here:

## Work done so far

We have a partially completed branch with updated PDF model: https://github.com/Notysoty/harmony/tree/updated_files_for_forntend but it needs work to complete it.
